                <dt>When HTML5 has become a standard? What were the main reasons for developing new standard? </dt>
                <dd>HTML5 became a standard on October 28, 2014. The main reasons for developing the new standard included the need for better support for multimedia elements like audio and video, improved interactivity with APIs, enhanced semantics for better accessibility, and the overall aim of standardizing and modernizing the web to keep up with advancements in technology.</dd>

                <dt>What is a difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
                <dd>The difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard is mainly in the development process and the formalization of the specification. W3C works on more formal versions of the HTML standard through drafts and recommendations, while WHATWG maintains a more living document that constantly evolves based on community feedback and implementation experience.</dd>

                <dt>What is the minimal HTML page code?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The minimal HTML page code consists of the following The minimal HTML page code consists of the essential elements required to create a basic web page structure. It typically includes the DOCTYPE html declaration at the beginning to specify the HTML version, followed by the opening and closing html tags to enclose the entire content of the page. Within the html tags, you have the head section where meta information, such as the page title, meta tags, and links to external resources, is placed. The title element inside the head section defines the title of the document displayed in the browser tab. The main content of the page is enclosed within the body tags, where you can include text, images, multimedia, and other elements to be rendered on the webpage. This minimal HTML structure provides a foundation for building more complex and visually appealing web pages.

                <dt>Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</dt>
                <dd>Semantic markup focuses on using HTML elements to convey the meaning and structure of content, while presentational markup directly defines how content should be visually presented. Presentational markup is considered deprecated because it mixes content with design, making it harder for search engines to understand the content and for assistive technologies to interpret it accurately.</dd>

                <dt>How you can check browser support for particular tag or attribute?</dt>
